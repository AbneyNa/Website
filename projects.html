            <h2>Projects</h2>
            
            <h3>Softball Tournament Website (Senior Design Project)</h3>
            <p>I am actively working on a website for my senior design project with a group for the Church of Nazarene Softball Tournament.
                Hosted on an EC2 instance using pm2, next.js, and sqlite.
                <a href="https://www.naznationals.com/" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Specifically, I have migrated the system from EC2 to Openstack, and am actively working on migration from sqlite to MySQL.</li>
                <li>One of the main learning points of the project (so far) has been learning how to manage legacy code and document code for
                    future developers. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Course Project (Intro To Software Engineering)</h3>
            <p>A group project where we made a web-server using flask and sqlite. It was made as a library interface that uses Amazon’s book database.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Through this project, I learned how to work with languages that I wasn't familiar with as well as how to incorporate databases in Flask.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Course Project (Data Structures)</h3>
            <p>Created a GPS Application that, using a list of addresses, distances, and times on roads will find the shortest route locally using Djikstra’s algorithm.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Through this project, I learned about complex data structures and how to incorporate them into functional applications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Course Project (Systems I)</h3>
            <p>I made a functional online 2 player Tic-Tac-Toe server and client with a classmate in C++ using the C++ web sockets to link clients through the network.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This project was particularly a fun one because my classmate and I were struggling with web sockets, and we had spent many nights staying up late in
                    order to figure out how they exactly worked.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Extinction’s Edge (Free Time)</h3>
            <p>This was a fun little side project I created over the summer of 2023. It's a top-down rogue-like game 
                where you fight through a dungeon as a dinosaur. It's available on Itch.io made in Godot using GDScript and good programming practices. 
                <a href="https://costellae-studios.itch.io/extinctions-edge" target="_blank">Play Game</a>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Within this project, I learned how capable I am of creating software entirely on my own. Beyond academics or professional applications, I do
                    have a passion for software and this little game I made was a reminder about that.
