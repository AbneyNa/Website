            <h3>Welcome.</h3>
            <p>I'm Nathan Abney - a Software Engineering major studying at Miami University. I was born and raised in Trenton, Ohio ,
                where I found my love for software development in my junior year of high school. Mr. Orlando, my engineering teacher, 
                allowed his students to create something that they wanted to create within reason and accompany it with a written
                summary regarding what they learned towards engineering. Given that opportunity, I decided to ask him if I
                could make a video game about him. Eager to see what I had in mind, he allowed me to give it a go.</p>

            <p>At the time neither him nor I knew anything about software, so he purchased me a Raspberry Pi 3 B+,
                the computer in which I used Pygame to create the game. Later on, I decided to migrate it to p5.js.
                Although it isn't exactly a masterpiece, it's a fun reminder to go back and see where I started.

            <p>Currently, I am working as a Computational Technical Intern at Applied Research Associates.
                I've been hard at work in the Applied Electromagnetics Division.
            </p>
            
            <p>With my current experience, I'd like to emphasize that my future will be exciting
                with more developments yet to come. Allow me to be part of your team, and you'll be adding a
                self-motivated, hard-working, and knowledgeable asset.</p>
